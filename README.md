# Dynamic-Guidance-System-Simulation

This project simulates a dynamic guidance system for a missile pursuing a moving target in an environment with potential obstacles. Using the Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) algorithm, the missile adjusts its trajectory in real-time, optimizing its path to stay on course toward the target while avoiding obstacles. This project serves as both a technical demonstration and a learning tool for understanding real-time trajectory adjustments and path optimization in constrained environments.

# Key Features

· Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG): The core algorithm used for trajectory adjustments.

· Dynamic Target and Obstacles: Both target and obstacles can follow various movement patterns.

· Real-Time Simulation and Metrics: The simulation provides a step-by-step display of position, distance, and performance metrics.
