# Dynamic-Guidance-System-Simulation
A C-based simulation that models a missileâ€™s trajectory adjustments in real-time to follow a moving target within a dynamic environment. This simulation implements the Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) algorithm, a standard in missile guidance, allowing for reactive path optimization while avoiding obstacles.
